# ColorGrid

![alt text](https://github.com/jonathas/colorgrid/blob/master/grid.png "Grid")

- Application renders the grid of similar size (e.g. 70x50) as displayed on the picture
- The grid squares are randomly filled with colors
- When user clicks on the filled square he/she copies its color (it is similar function like e.g. color picker tool in Gimp)
- Once the color is copied, clicking by the mouse cursor on the empty square, application fills the square with the already copied color
- Only empty squares can be filled with color, already filled squares cannot change their color
- Squares can be connected only by use of the same color they are.
- The goal is connecting all the squares of the same color
